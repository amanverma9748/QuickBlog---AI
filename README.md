In this full stack project named QuickBlog - AI, I had build a blogging platform using MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS. 
In this full stack blog platform I had will integrated the AI Feature (artificial intelligence) to generate the blog content. 
In this blog portal I had build the admin dashboard also, where admin can post a new blog and manage existing blogs and comments. 
After building this full stack blog portal I will deploy it online using vercel.
